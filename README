Structure:

The code is structured into files/classes. In the main file "SRD2Dsubmission.pde" we define all the 
parameters, initialize the objects corresponding to particles and cells, then run the simulation iterations 
in an infinite loop (function "draw"). This loop also include the interactions with the user 
(keyboard or mouse) and rendering.

The file "Particle.pde" first declares the attributes of a particle such as its position, velocity, the 
index of its associated cell, etc. The computation of the local repulsion and SRD collision steps is 
defined here, as well as the application of the gravity and the pressure force, and finally the advection 
of a particle before the next iteration.

The file "Cell.pde" declares the attribute of a cell, including its position and a list of the particles it 
contains. All the code needed for cell pressure computation is defined here, such as average velocity, 
divergence, pressure, pressure gradient and density ratio. An integer value is also used to characterize if 
the cell is empty, has an empty cell neighbor, or is surrounded by non-empty cells.

An additional file "Ball.pde" defines the behavior of the moving ball interacting with the fluid.
